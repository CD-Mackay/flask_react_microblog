# Flask-React Microblog
   Welcome to the Flask-React microblog. This project is part of my journey to learn different languages, focussing on languages with utility in backend development. 

   This project uses a modern ReactJs front-end to connect to a python powered API. 

## Usage
  - This project will require two terminals to run. 
  - Frontend: 
      - To run the front-end cd into the /frontend directory. Run npm install to install dependencies, and npm start to begin the application
  
  - API: 
      - CD into /api directory. From here run the command python3 -m venv venv to initialize the virtual environment. 
      - Run pip install to install neccessary dependencies
      - flask run command initializes API.
